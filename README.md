# 🚲 E-Bike Rental Dashboard in Excel (No Pivot Tables)

This project showcases a fully dynamic Excel dashboard built **without using Pivot Tables**.

Instead of relying on Pivot Tables, I used powerful Excel functions like:
- `SUMIFS`, `COUNTIFS` for KPI calculations
- `FILTER`, `SORT`, `UNIQUE` for dynamic data views
- `XLOOKUP` for flexible lookups

## 📌 Why No Pivot Tables?

Pivot Tables are great, but they come with issues:
- Formatting resets on refresh
- External link errors
- File size bloat
- Reduced flexibility when sharing or collaborating

This project was built entirely with formulas to maintain:
- Cleaner file structure
- Lighter file size
- More shareable and reliable performance
